testing plans

1: when sample loaded, button is disabled
2: when sample loaded, the number of total markers should be 10
3: when a marker is created, the total number of markers should be 1
4: when a marker is created, then sample data is loaded, the total number of
markers should be 11.
5: when a marker is created, it's rotation, id, and x and y should match the one
