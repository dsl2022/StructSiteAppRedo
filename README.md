## Requirement

- Render all of the markers that have been attached to a given floor plan, not just the single one shown in the starter. (see sample_data.json)

- Change the markers to use an arrow icon, and make each point in the direction indicated by the rotation value in sample_data.json.

- Allow the user to move an existing marker around by clicking and dragging it. Persist the new location when they are done.

- Click anywhere on the map to add a new marker. Ultimately, this is also how the user will attach photos to the marker at that location.
